                  <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I worked on my own web portfolio website. It was a challenging but enjoyable experience that I really learned a lot from.I would like to thank <mark>Brad Traversey</mark> for demonstrating this wonderful template.
                     For creating this website I have used "VS Code", "Node JS" and "Git bash". I have used "SCSS" as an extended stylesheet language as it has the functionality that did not exists in "CSS". <br>
                     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since HTML do not understand SCSS language the code written in SCSS has been converted to CSS language. For making website go online I have used GITHUB.<br>

                      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is quite easy to develop with some simple validations and error checks. Player-1 starts playing the game and both the players make their moves in consecutive turns. The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.   <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is a one page website, I have used <b>CSS</b> for styling and <b>JAVASCRIPT</b> for performing the simple operations and to have the validation on the web page.<br>

                              <p>Event management system is used to manage all the activity related to event. In any event many service providers work simultaneously and it is very hard to manage these providers. <br>
                                It is also important for event organizer that he has all the contacts details of these service providers so that he can contact them any time to plan an event at given time. To manage all these activity we have developed this software. <br>
                                In present system event company have to do all management work manually. They keep all payment information on papers. There is no system to check the past expenses on any event. To do this they have to check payment register and this task is very time consuming and tiresome. Keeping all these problem in mind we have developed this system. This system helps the event management company to manage their paper work online and they can also retrieve report of last event they have completed. <br>
